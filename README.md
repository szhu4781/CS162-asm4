# CS162-asm4

This is a program is user interactive game known as Hunt the Wumpus. In this program,
the user plays as an adventurer exploring Wumpus's cave to hunt and kill Wumpus or seek
out the hidden treasure. The user can set the grid size of the cave and move the adventurer
throughout different rooms within the grid. Each room can randomly generate a new event each
time the program is executed. These events are hidden on the grid, meaning you won't be able to see
what's inside of which room.

Note: Debug mode is only used for debugging. You can see all events in the debug mode.
